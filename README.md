# Blackpines

## Purpose
This is a backup copy of the code for the Blackpines project (https://blackpines.co.uk), the purpose of this project is to streamline social media management by allowing users to post on multiple different social medial platforms from a single place by utilising the APIs provided by Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook. This project also was a good excuse to make a MEAN stack application.

## Features & Functionality
 - User's can signup & login to Blackpines
 - User's can connect to their Twitter accounts
 - User's can view the twitter home timelines
 - User's can view their own tweets
 - User's can make tweets from Blackpines

## Known Issues
 - Facebook API doesn't pass through a API token secret - if this isn't needed for API requests to facebook then it won't be a problem

## Notes
 - Instagram will be removed as a supported platform, the app/website will need to be in a near or fully completed state in order for instagram developers to green light the use of the API. The rest of Blackpines will be completed before attempting to get access again, as at this point getting access has only delayed development and isn't currently worth the time.
