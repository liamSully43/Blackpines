# Blackpines

## Purpose
This is a backup copy of the code for the Blackpines project (https://blackpines.co.uk), the purpose of this project is to streamline social media management by allowing users to post on multiple different social medial platforms from a single place by utilising the APIs provided by Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook. This project also was a good excuse to make a MEAN stack application.

## Known Issues
None

## Notes
Blackpines now only supports Twitter, Facebook isn't onboarding any new individual devs to gain real access to the API (other than pulling very basic account info), these means the Facebook API can't be used until post covid. This will also mean Instagram cannot be added either as you need to be setup with the Facebook API to use the Instagram API.

The LinkedIn API doesn't support many of the intended features other than creating new posts, and they have changed the syntax of their API without updating any documentation - making it almost impossible to use.

Blackpines will now be a Twitter account management app that supports connecting up to 5 Twitter accounts at once.
