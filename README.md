## Notes
Blackpines now only supports Twitter, Facebook isn't onboarding any new individual devs to gain real access to the API (other than pulling very basic account info), these means the Facebook API can't be used until post covid. This will also mean Instagram cannot be added either as you need to be set up with the Facebook API to use the Instagram API.

The LinkedIn API doesn't support many of the intended features other than creating new posts, and they have changed the syntax of their API without updating any documentation - making it almost impossible to use.

Blackpines will now serve as a Twitter account management app that supports connecting up to 5 Twitter accounts at once. User's can then interact with other accounts & tweets using which ever connected account they chose. They can also view each accounts home timeline & personal posts.
