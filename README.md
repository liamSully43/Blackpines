# Blackpines

## Purpose
This is a backup copy of the code for the Blackpines project (https://blackpines.co.uk), the purpose of this project is to streamline social media management by allowing users to post on multiple different social medial platforms from a single place by utilising the APIs provided by Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook. This project also was a good excuse to make a MEAN stack application.

## Features & Functionality
 - User's can sign up & login to Blackpines
 - User's can connect to their Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook accounts
 - User's can view the Twitter home timelines
 - User's can view any of their tweets
 - User's can view any twitter account
 - User's can make tweets from Blackpines
 - User's can Search for tweets & Twitter accounts

## Known Issues
 - Facebook API doesn't pass through an API token secret - if this isn't needed for API requests to Facebook then it won't be a problem

## Notes
/my-feed has had a layout redesign to be more user friendly & straight forward
