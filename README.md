# Blackpines

## Purpose
This is a backup copy of the code for the Blackpines project (https://blackpines.co.uk), the purpose of this project is to streamline social media management by allowing users to post on multiple different social medial platforms from a single place by utilising the APIs provided by Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook. This project also was a good excuse to make a MEAN stack application.

## Features & Functionality
 - User's can signup & login to Blackpines
 - User's can connect to their Twitter accounts
 - User's can view the twitter home timelines
 - User's can view their own tweets
 - User's can make tweets from Blackpines

## Known Issues
 - Facebook API doesn't pass through a API token secret - if this isn't needed for API requests to facebook then it won't be a problem

## Notes
 - Added new Search page, only the basic layout & design has been implimented. The child components of the page have been added & connected so that the search filters (platforms & posts vs users) are handles & queried by the search page component & TS.
